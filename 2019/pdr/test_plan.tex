 \begin{tabular}{||c | c | p{70mm}||} 
 \hline
 \textit{ID} & \textit{Title} & \textit{Details} \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 T1 & Power consumption & Volt- and ammeter connected in parallel and series respectively to LiPo battery. \\
 \hline
 T2 & Control system & Hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop testing of custom flight controller and all autonomous features (e.g. take-off, landing). \\
 \hline
 T3 & Airframes stability & Simulation of aircraft using Simulink. Aerodynamic coefficients gathered via AVL (DATCOM alternative). \\
 \hline
 T4 & Flight Termination System & Manual and automatic activation of FTS, by toggle switch or disconnecting uplink/downlink telemetry. \\
 \hline
 T5 & Range Test & Testing maximum distance away from base-station and master controller that telemetry signal level is above minimum threshold. \\
 \hline
 T6 & Waypoint navigation & Fly through a set of pre-defined GPS waypoints and determine navigational accuracy. \\
 \hline
 T7 & Payload delivery & Drop of all payloads, both manually and automatically, above pre-defined GPS waypoints. \\
