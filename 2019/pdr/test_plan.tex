\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ p{0.04\textwidth} | X | p{0.6\textwidth} } 
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Title} & \textbf{Details} \\ \hline
T1 & Power consumption & Volt- and ammeter connected in parallel and series respectively to LiPo battery. \\ \hline
T2 & Control system & Hardware-in-the-loop and software-in-the-loop testing of custom flight controller and all autonomous features (e.g. take-off, landing). \\ \hline
T3 & Airframes stability & Simulation of aircraft using Simulink. Aerodynamic coefficients gathered via AVL (DATCOM alternative). \\ \hline
T4 & Flight Termination System & Manual and automatic activation of FTS, by toggle switch or disconnecting uplink/downlink telemetry. \\ \hline
T5 & Range Test & Testing maximum distance away from base-station and master controller that telemetry signal level is above minimum threshold. \\ \hline
T6 & Waypoint navigation & Fly through a set of pre-defined GPS waypoints and determine navigational accuracy. \\ \hline
T7 & Payload delivery & Drop of all payloads, both manually and automatically, above pre-defined GPS waypoints. \\
